  ;; Committing Performance
  ;;
  ;; When you initiate a commit, then Magit by default automatically shows a diff
  ;; of the changes you are about to commit. For large commits this can take a long
  ;; time, which is especially distracting when you are committing large amounts of
  ;; generated data which you donâ€™t actually intend to inspect before committing.
  ;; This behavior can be turned off using:
  (remove-hook 'server-switch-hook 'magit-commit-diff)
  ;; Then you can type C-c C-d to show the diff when you actually want to see it,
  ;; but only then. Alternatively you can leave the hook alone and just type C-g in
  ;; those cases when it takes too long to generate the diff. If you do that, then
  ;; you will end up with a broken diff buffer, but doing it this way has the
  ;; advantage that you usually get to see the diff, which is useful because it
  ;; increases the odds that you spot potential issues.
